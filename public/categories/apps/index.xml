      <description>In the same vein as the toolbox post I put up in March, I wanted to post a list of my most-used Chrome extensions.
I don&amp;rsquo;t use many Chrome extensions, but there are a few that I completely rely on every day. I get asked occasionally what these are and if I could share the links to some of these things, so here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the best ones.</description>

      <description>This is a list of the things I use literally every single day, and that I would be lost without. Like a blacksmith has hammers, I&amp;rsquo;ve got these things. A lot of them are free, and some of them are not. In total, this represents less than $200 of software.
For significantly improving your quality of life, that&amp;rsquo;s a completely acceptable cost to me, especially because I make my living with this stuff.</description>

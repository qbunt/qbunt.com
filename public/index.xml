      <title>You should get a VPN (really)</title>

      <description>VPNs are super useful tools for keeping your information private for any reason. If you&amp;rsquo;re on coffee shop WiFi and need to do some banking (tho I&amp;rsquo;d advise strongly against doing this) you should do that on a VPN. A VPN is not a miracle solution for online security, and there are many security holes in even getting your data to the machine. If you have a virus or some other horrible thing on your machine, a VPN won&amp;rsquo;t help you.</description>

      <description>I just put this on Twitter, but I thought it could use a more permanent home. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;ll just add it to Toothpick. For now though, I&amp;rsquo;m sure someone is struggling with it right now.
const replaceSmartQuotes = str =&amp;gt; str.replace(/[\u2018\u2019]/g, &amp;quot;&#39;&amp;quot;).replace(/[\u201C\u201D]/g, ‘”’)`  </description>

      <description>Because of the Equifax information breach, many people are curious about how they can protect their identity.
I think many people think well, the hackers have all my info, I can&amp;rsquo;t do anything, right?
You should assume your information has been compromised. What can you do about it? Literally the cheapest and easiest way to protect your identity is to freeze your credit file.
Contrary to what others may say, there are are actually 4 (not 3) credit reporting bureaus, EquiFax, Experian, TransUnion and Innovis (that&amp;rsquo;s the weird one).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been using the excellent Resin platform for deploying Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s en masse at work. One of the issues we frequently have is the wifi we&amp;rsquo;re connecting to is either unknown, or incorrect, so we have to update the wifi configuration on a group of devices. Because this need was not met by either Resin-wifi-connect or anything else, we wrote a tiny app to pick configuration value out of the Resin environment variables.</description>

      <description>Small update to the theme I released last year. This one is a variation on what I pushed out, but has a little bit of a typographic nod to the Palm Pre (yes, that Palm Pre). I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for a while, and haven&amp;rsquo;t updated this repo in a bit. Download from GitHub and give it a whirl. I&amp;rsquo;ve deprecated the &amp;lsquo;Day&amp;rsquo; version because nobody was using it (including myself) and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like maintaining it.</description>

      <description>Updated my &amp;lsquo;Smoked&amp;rsquo; theme package for the excellent Alfred. I took a bit more time on these than I did on the first release. There&amp;rsquo;s a new halo around the entire window, something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t possible in the earlier versions of Alfred.
The screenshots of these are kind of difficult because the OS X capture doesn&amp;rsquo;t render the blur filter correctly. The only real difference is that the sub-title on the non-selected items isn&amp;rsquo;t visible by default.</description>

      <description>Update 1/11/16: Current version of Chrome 47.0.2526.106 resolves this behavior.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing some short machine freezes while using both OS X Yosemite and El Capitan. Could not figure this out for a while and I think I found the culprit.
These short freezes last about 2-4 seconds, only appear while Chrome (production) is running, and appear to freeze not just Chrome but the entire machine.
When Chrome runs a software update in the background, it throws the following message in the console &amp;quot;triggered DYLD shared region unnest for map&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>If for some reason you need the following things out of an NGinX server:
 Multiple virtual blocks Basic authentication (with IP whitelist of approved IPs Customized error messages  there are some things you should probably be aware of, as the virtual block configuration is not obvious.
First off, custom error messages are straightforward if and only if you do not have basic auth enabled.
If you do, you need to ensure two things.</description>

      <description>UPDATE 11/5/15
 With the Pi 2, amperage requirements are significantly higher, presumably due to the doubling of cores in the machine, more IO, etc. I&amp;rsquo;m changing my recommendation to a different power supply that provides clean 2.5A power for the Pi 2.
Also, please note that the Pi 2 requires a microSD card instead of the standard SD card format from the original Pi, recommending a microSD card.</description>

      <description>There are some crazy things about this video and how the NYC subway system works. Huge swaths of infrastructure are over 80 years old. They use cloth-covered wire as the means of connection between critical pieces of switching equipment. Thankfully, they&amp;rsquo;re getting slowly upgraded, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to take many many years.
I&amp;rsquo;m amazed it still works, but it&amp;rsquo;s been working 24&amp;frasl;7 for the last 80 years.</description>

      <description>OnShape is a brand new creation from the original team that built out SolidWorks. This is sort of a combination of the concepts that makes Google Docs great mated with a world class solids modeling package. We can finally do all of these things in the browser and run it on something as low power as a cell phone.
With a tool like this and the proliferation of inexpensive 3D printers, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see this as anything except a major game changer.</description>

      <description>I have an infatuation with the Alfred app. It hits so many of the nerd things that I love, last year I put a theme together for Alfred to fit along with the way I have my machine set up.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m updating my theme significantly, and adding a brand new light theme to the mix.
I&amp;rsquo;ve put it up on Github, feel free to change it up. Enjoy!

      <guid>/posts/node-js-moves-out-of-joyents-control/</guid>
      <description>Great news from Joyent about Node.js moving to break off into an open source foundation. Presumably this is a reaction to key players in the Node community breaking off to write io.js and the impact that will have on the platform&amp;rsquo;s growth. What I find interesting about this news is the stakeholders involved in the foundation, who are definitely not a small community (WalMart, PayPal, LinkedIn, Microsoft and others).
My hope for this effort is that development continues to move into a stable direction, and Node moves far away from the unsupported, basically deprecated version of V8 it&amp;rsquo;s currently running on.</description>

      <description>When you going into multiple servers at once, it can be handy to have a little leeway when you use password authentication. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;re SSHing into one box, then another, then back to the first box.
It&amp;rsquo;d be really nice not to have to paste that first password in again, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it?
From my buddy Phil, he&amp;rsquo;s got a handy SSH config that will recycle the first authenticated session when you try to connect again.</description>

      <description>PolarClock circa 2008
Built in Flash as a screensaver, an OS X Widget and apparently adapted to the iPhone. It was a free screensaver that I loved for many years. It&amp;rsquo;s a great design.
Not that PolarClock owns this shape, but this Apple Fitness design feels like a ripoff. Even the colors are similar.</description>

      <description>Not that Apple hasn&amp;rsquo;t made enough news this week, but this is far too disappointing to let go. Yesterday, along with the watch and the iPhone 6 announcment, Apple has made their website responsive (part of it anyway). What appears now is a totally broken design for many of their pages. Not small pages either. Clearly they thought about the product pages for the iPhone and the watch and just said &amp;ldquo;eh, that seems good&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re checking out Google&amp;rsquo;s Angular, I highly recommend John Lindquist&amp;rsquo;s Egghead.io for learning the framework quickly and with lots of insight.
Angular is a super powerful framework and seems to be the way things are heading for building scalable large JS apps. If you&amp;rsquo;re building out a larger client side app, it&amp;rsquo;s worth a look.</description>

      <description>This is a list of the things I use literally every single day, and that I would be lost without. Like a blacksmith has hammers, I&amp;rsquo;ve got these things. A lot of them are free, and some of them are not. In total, this represents less than $200 of software.
For significantly improving your quality of life, that&amp;rsquo;s a completely acceptable cost to me, especially because I make my living with this stuff.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often you hear of a new startup that&amp;rsquo;s building something in America, especially watches&amp;hellip;in Detroit. Shinola is going for American watchmaking with their line of pretty handsome watches. As a fan of people going against the grain and trying something bat-shit crazy, they&amp;rsquo;re going for it in a pretty big way. They&amp;rsquo;re building their own movements with Swiss parts and really going for it.
The Verge did a nice piece on Shinola&amp;rsquo;s Detroit factory, check it out.</description>

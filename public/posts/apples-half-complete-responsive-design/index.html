    <p>Not that Apple hasn't made enough news this week, but this is far too disappointing to let go. Yesterday, along with the watch and the iPhone 6 announcment, Apple has made their website responsive (part of it anyway). What appears now is a totally broken design for many of their pages. Not small pages either. Clearly they thought about the product pages for the iPhone and the watch and just said &ldquo;eh, that seems good&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I hope the watch is more complete than this <strong>half ass web design</strong> when it comes out next year.</p>
<p>These are screenshots taken on an Android phone.</p>

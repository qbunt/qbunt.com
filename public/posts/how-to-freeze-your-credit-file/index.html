You should assume your information has been compromised.

        <p><strong>Update:</strong> Keeping the freeze links up to date on this post, I had to use it again recently and a couple were dead</p>
<p>Because of the Equifax information breach, many people are curious about how they can protect their identity.</p>
<p>I think many people think <em>well, the hackers have all my info, I can&rsquo;t do anything, right?</em></p>
<p>You should assume your information has been compromised.</p>
<p>What can you do about it? Literally the cheapest and easiest way to protect your identity is to freeze your credit file.</p>
<p>Contrary to what others <em>may</em> say, there are are actually 4 (not 3) credit reporting bureaus, EquiFax, Experian, TransUnion <em>and</em> Innovis (that&rsquo;s the weird one).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is this so important and what does it do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freezing your credit file places a PIN number protected hold on your credit file. You cannot take out loans, new credit cards, or open new lines of credit <em>without the PIN</em>. If someone has access to your information, they can take out credit cards, open a mortgage, buy property, etc, but not without <em>access to some level of credit</em>.</p>
<p>Freezing will prevent you from taking out new credit cards, buying cars, opening a home loan and the like. If you do this a lot, <strong>this isn&rsquo;t for you</strong>, though it&rsquo;s very easy to lift a freeze for a week</p>
<p>Credit freeze access is the law in 49 states (sorry Michigan), and is easy, inexpensive, and easy to lift if you need to (it may take 24 hours).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sounds kind of expensive, what does it cost?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In California, the only agency that charged me was TransUnion <del>and it was $10. Worth every penny</del>.</p>
<p><em><em>Update</em></em>: As of 1/17/24, Transunion no longer charges for freezing your file.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m impervious because I have a credit monitoring service&hellip;right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice from <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/are-credit-monitoring-services-worth-it/">Brian Krebs</a> is pretty detailed. While one agency might provide a service, there are very few that cover all four agencies. Coverage and what these services <em>actually do</em> is kind of all over the map and in some cases, may even be reselling information you want protected.</p>
<p>Giving <em>someone else</em> the responsibility to watch over my credit seems like a flawed concept. These &lsquo;plans&rsquo; are a great way to sell a service to make people feel like they&rsquo;re doing something, when in reality, they&rsquo;re mostly sold by the credit bureaus to build a new line of business for something they should be protecting anyway.</p>
<p>A credit report freeze is effective, cheaper and actually does something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright, how do I freeze my credit file?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visit each one of these and register a freeze on your file. Be <strong>sure</strong> to save the PIN they give you in a safe place. If you need to thaw your file for some reason, this PIN number is what you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://freeze.transunion.com/sf/securityFreeze/landingPage.jsp">Transunion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/">Equifax</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.innovis.com/securityFreeze/index">Innovis</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.experian.com/ncaconline/freeze#registration">Experian</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve done this, be sure to visit this link to opt-out of the pre-screened credit card offers via email and snailmail.

<blockquote>
<p>Where do I find out more?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/">Brian Krebs</a> is the authority here. He was the guy to break the story on the Target breach and many, many more. Credit freezes are pretty simple and can <em>help</em> protect your credit.</p>
<p>Freezing your credit file is not a magic bullet, the Equifax breach is bad news. This is one measure you can put in place to help preserve your financial well-being.</p>

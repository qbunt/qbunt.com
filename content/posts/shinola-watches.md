It's not often you hear of a new startup that's building something in America, especially watches...in Detroit. [Shinola](http://www.shinola.com/) is going for
American watchmaking with their line of [pretty handsome watches](http://www.shinola.com/shop/watches/the-brakeman-leather-band-watch-s002.html). As a fan of
people going against the grain and trying something bat-shit crazy, they're going for it in a pretty big way. They're building their own movements with Swiss
parts and really going for it.

The Verge did a nice piece on Shinola's Detroit factory, check it out.

Because of the Equifax information breach, many people are curious about how they can protect their identity. 

I think many people think *well, the hackers have all my info, I can't do anything, right?*

**You should assume your information has been compromised**. What can you do about it? Literally the cheapest and easiest way to protect your identity is to freeze your credit file.

Contrary to what others *may* say, there are are actually 4 (not 3) credit reporting bureaus, EquiFax, Experian, TransUnion *and* Innovis (that's the weird one).

**Why is this so important and what does it do?**
Freezing your credit file places a PIN number protected hold on your credit file. You cannot take out loans, new credit cards, or open new lines of credit *without the PIN*. If someone has access to your information, they can take out credit cards, open a mortgage, buy property, etc, but not without *access to some level of credit*. 

This will also prevent you from taking out new credit cards, buying cars, opening a home loan and the like. If you do this a lot, **this isn't for you.**

Credit freeze access is the law in 49 states (sorry Michigan), and is easy, inexpensive, and easy to lift if you need to (it may take 24 hours).

**Sounds kind of expensive, what does it cost?**
In California, the only agency that charged me was TransUnion and it was $10. Worth every penny.

**Well I'm impervious because I have a credit monitoring service...right?**
The advice from [Brian Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2014/03/are-credit-monitoring-services-worth-it/) is pretty detailed. While one agency might provide a service, there are very few that cover all four agencies. Coverage and what these services *actually do* is kind of all over the map.

Giving *someone else* the responsibility to watch over my credit seems like a flawed concept. These 'plans' are a great way to sell a service to make people feel like they're doing something.

A credit report freeze is very, cheaper, and actually does something.

**Alright, how do I freeze my credit file?**
Visit each one of these and register a freeze on your file. Be **sure** to save the PIN they give you in a safe place. If you need to thaw your file for some reason, this PIN number is what you'll need.

**Where do I find out more?**
Again, [Brian Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/the-equifax-breach-what-you-should-know/) is the authority here. He was the guy to break the story on the Target breach and many, many more. Credit freezes are pretty simple and can *help* protect your credit.

Freezing your credit file is not a magic bullet, the Equifax breach is bad news. This is one measure you can put in place to help preserve your financial well-being.

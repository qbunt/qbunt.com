If you're checking out [Google's Angular](http://angularjs.org/), I highly recommend John Lindquist's [Egghead.io](http://egghead.io/lessons) for learning the framework quickly and with lots of insight.

[Angular](http://angularjs.org/) is a super powerful framework and seems to be the way things are heading for building scalable large JS apps. If you're building out a
larger client side app, it's worth a look.

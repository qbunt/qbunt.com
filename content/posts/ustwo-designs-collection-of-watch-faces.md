USTwo just designed 40 watch faces for the Android Wear system of wearable devices. Better yet, [they open sourced a ton of the resources they used](http://wear.ustwo.com/#resources). Exciting news for wearable computing and interesting to see people gaining the ability to customize their watch faces.

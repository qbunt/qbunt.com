title: Metro for Alfred 4
---
Every once in a while I build a new theme for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) because I use it so much, and I do enjoy having nice looking UI around. This one is different than the last few I've done, and this one I think will last a bit longer because it's using such simple typesetting, I think it's likely to age well.

Anyway, I hope you use it and enjoy it, if you do, please do share it around.

I love Apple computers, I always have, but I no longer have an iPhone, an iPad or any other iOS device. I've been an Apple fan for years, and I can't put my finger on what's going on. It's not the [increasing angst](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground), it's more nuanced than that.

After my iPhone 4 ceased being useful as a primary device (due a new OS upgrade) several years ago, I stopped buying iOS devices. It wasn't *just* the software update, it dropped calls constantly, insisted on showing me every single animation, regardless of how slow it would be and insisted on never *actually* working with Bluetooth. It stopped being useful for me a year and a half in. This is after 4 replacements (all warranty mechanical problems honestly).

This is not unusual at all.

My wife Jessica has an iPhone 5C. It's not doing the same thing, but is now so full of photos and video the only logical thing to do is to clear everything off by jacking it into iTunes. I can't clear out old iMessage images or videos that have been shared without pouring through hundreds (honestly, potentially thousands) of messages. It also sounds muffled, erratically, just often enough that I'm sure if I tried to get it fixed, it would work just fine.

What I'm getting to is that for a long time (most of my young adult life), Apple was among the best (arguably *the best*) in the world with software. The UI/UX, animations, stability and overall quality of their hardware and software was the best available.

Apple's the most successful it's ever been. Microsoft held a similar crown for a very long time in the 90's. That doesn't mean their software was the best then. That mediocrity and lack of hunger, that's what gave Apple a chance to shine. Apple was an underdog.

With Apple on top of the world, there's room for a new underdog. One that's hungrier, scrappier and crazy enough to build the *really insane shit.* I don't think that company is under one roof anymore. Tesla, Square, Pebble, Uber (kinda), Nest, Oculus, (yes, even Microsoft) and a few others are just crazy enough to really make things count. The most exciting part about this, is that Apple bootstrapped excitement around technology, bigger than any single product. It's not going to be a watch, or a phone, it's not a single thing, it's a hive-mind over technology and the role it plays in live, pop-culture and every single day.

> Apple bootstrapped excitement around technology, bigger than any single product

While everyone is doing their own bootstrapping thing, they're playing a note in Apple's song. Apple played a role, indirectly or not, and everyone's benefitted by opening a massive conversation about personal technology. The biggest thing was not an iPhone, or a watch, or a gold laptop .....sigh.... . It's starting the discussion about technology, keeping that conversation alive, and speculating about what the future could look like.

I'm not saying what Apple's done is insignificant, far from it. My point is that the next thing, next phone or next iPad is not the thing Apple is selling, they're selling **the next**. Now, we're all thinking about what the future looks like. 

The details are fuzzy, but bringing the future to today, that's more exciting than a phone, from Apple or not.

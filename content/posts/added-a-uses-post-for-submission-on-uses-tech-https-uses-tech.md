I've added a [uses](https://qbunt.com/uses) page to this site so it could be submitted to the totally excellent (and super fascinating) [uses.tech](https://uses.tech). I'm fascinated with the tools that people use to do their job, and it was pretty interesting to collect a list of all the crazy stuff I use to get my job done. I spend a lot of time at my desk, and seeing how other people set up their spaces and what they use has been cool

[Check my list out here](https://qbunt.com/uses) and check out everyone else's setup at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech)!

There are some crazy things about this video and how the NYC subway system works. Huge swaths of infrastructure are over 80 years old. They use cloth-covered wire as the means of connection between critical pieces of switching equipment. Thankfully, they're getting slowly upgraded, but it's going to take many many years.

I'm amazed it still works, but it's been working 24/7 for the last 80 years.

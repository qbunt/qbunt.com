[Great news from Joyent](http://www.joyent.com/about/press/joyent-moves-to-establish-nodejs-foundation) about Node.js moving to break off into an open source foundation. Presumably this is a reaction to key players in the Node community breaking off to write [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html) and the impact that will have on the platform's growth. What I find interesting about this news is the stakeholders involved in the foundation, who are definitely not a small community (WalMart, PayPal, LinkedIn, Microsoft and others).

My hope for this effort is that development continues to move into a stable direction, and Node moves far away from the unsupported, basically deprecated version of V8 it's currently running on. The worry is that with all the big names in the ring, development will stop dead. We'll see what happens, in the meantime, hey there's [io.js](https://iojs.org/en/index.html).

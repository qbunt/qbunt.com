Updated my 'Smoked' theme package for the excellent [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). I took a bit more time on these than I did on the first release. There's a new halo around the entire window, something that wasn't possible in the earlier versions of Alfred.

The screenshots of these are kind of difficult because the OS X capture doesn't render the blur filter correctly. The only real difference is that the sub-title on the non-selected items isn't visible by default.

I would love to [hear any feedback over on Github](https://github.com/qbunt/smoked/issues). If you think something should be tweaked, feel free to open a PR, I'm pretty frequently tweaking this theme.

[Download the entire pack here](https://github.com/qbunt/smoked/archive/v2.0.zip)

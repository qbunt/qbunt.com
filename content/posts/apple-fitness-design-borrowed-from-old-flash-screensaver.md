[PolarClock](http://blog.pixelbreaker.com/polarclock) *circa 2008* 

Built in Flash as a screensaver, an OS X Widget and apparently adapted to the iPhone. It was a free screensaver that I loved for many years. It's a great design.

Not that PolarClock owns this shape, but this Apple Fitness design  feels like a ripoff. Even the *colors* are similar.

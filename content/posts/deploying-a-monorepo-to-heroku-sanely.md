title = "Deploying a monorepo to Heroku sanely with Github Actions"

+++
Heroku has made some [questionable business choices](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter) recently, but the one thing they got dead-right straight out of the gate was ease of setup. With very little work, you could go from a working thing locally, add a couple files, and `git push` your way to a deployed environment. That simple interaction made so much complexity go away, I think many hosting services are still after the bar that Heroku set so early.

In that time, things have gotten a lot more complex.

Github actions has become ubiquitous, static hosting has gotten very simple, and web tooling has evolved very, **very** quickly. One of the largest changes I've seen in this space is moving from single-project repos, to monorepos. Monorepos make a ton of sense, especially when you have several services all interconnected into the same project. When it comes to deploying to our old friend Heroku though, a monorepo adds a new layer that Heroku has **certainly** not kept up with.

Deploying to Heroku with a single-project repo:  
`git push heroku main`

Deploying to Heroku **with a monorepo**:  
`git subtree push --prefix apiOne heroku-apiOne master`

> Okay...what is the big deal

When you aren't using the Github/Heroku integration (say, for instance, because there was a [massive data breach]()) but you still need to ship code, that gets a lot more complicated.

The options then become:

* Use the multi-procfile buildpack and get your `git push git@heroku.com:<app> master` style deployments back (peppering your codebase with procfiles)
* Deploy the apps locally with `git subtree` and witness the endless errors with that ðŸ¤®
* Wait for the data breach mitigations to complete

Then, you need the same process to run in github actions because that's where the rest of the CI/CD pipelines are. There has to be some alternative to this. Thank

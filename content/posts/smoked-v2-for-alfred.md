Small update to the theme I released last year. This one is a variation on what I pushed out, but has a little bit of a typographic nod to the Palm Pre (yes, that Palm Pre). I've been using it for a while, and haven't updated this repo in a bit. 
[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/qbunt/smoked/archive/v2.1.zip) and give it a whirl. I've deprecated the 'Day' version because nobody was using it (including myself) and I didn't really feel like maintaining it.

Hope you enjoy it!

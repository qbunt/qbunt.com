In the style of many other developers on the web, I thought it'd be interesting to collect a list of things that I use throughout my day. Many of these are pretty standard for a developer, but there are truly some gems in there (the command line tools especially.

Much of this gear is what I find myself using daily for development or for staying caffeinated and sane :D. Many of these things evolve throughout what I'm doing
